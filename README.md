*Simulation of the Mercado Libre page to put anatomy concepts into practice on a website.*

------------


During the Fullstack Developer course we are proposed to create a page similar to Mercado Libre, an Argentine company dedicated to electronic commerce, to test what we have learned about "Anatomy of websites" using HTML, CSS and JS.

It is our first experience of these characteristics, so we work on the layout and styles of the page and not on the development of the back-end.
